# Holographic Quantum Computing Implementation

A Python implementation exploring the intersection of quantum computing, black holes, and holographic principles.

## Overview

This project implements a quantum computing system that leverages holographic principles and quantum error correction to explore novel approaches to quantum information storage and processing. It combines concepts from quantum mechanics, black hole physics, and the AdS/CFT correspondence to create a framework for encoding and manipulating quantum information using holographic principles.

The implementation explores how quantum information might be stored and processed in a way analogous to how information is theoretically stored on the surface of a black hole (the holographic principle). This approach may offer advantages in terms of error correction and information density.

## Key Concepts

### Holographic Principle
The holographic principle suggests that the information content of a region of space can be encoded on its boundary. In black holes, this manifests as all the information being encoded on the event horizon. This project applies this principle to quantum computing by encoding quantum states using a boundary/bulk relationship.

### AdS/CFT Correspondence
The implementation uses concepts from the AdS/CFT correspondence, a theoretical framework that describes a relationship between quantum gravity in Anti-de Sitter space and Conformal Field Theory on its boundary. This correspondence provides the mathematical foundation for the holographic encoding.

### Quantum Error Correction
The project incorporates error correction mechanisms inspired by how information might be preserved in black holes. This includes both active error correction and passive error protection through holographic encoding.
